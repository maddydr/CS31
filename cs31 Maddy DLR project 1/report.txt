Original file with nonsensical integer 
* Input: 600000000000
* Output: said that -40.7% will vote for Gavin, and -40.7% will vote for Brian
   * Then output: “Gavin is predicted to win the election.”
* Program never asked user how many will vote for each candidate
* Happens because of integer overflow


Logic error
* For my error logic error, I switched the equality sign on line 30: switching > to < sign
* Now printing, if Gavin has less votes, he is “predicted to win” when in reality, he is not
* For example, when I input 45 votes will go to Gavin and only 15 to Brian, it says Brian is predicted to win, which is wrong
* The code still compiles, but the logic is incorrect


Compile error
* For my 1st compile error, I deleted the semicolon on line 17 
   * The error message came back with: “expected ';' before 'cin'” which makes sense as I omitted the semicolon
* For my 2nd error, I used the wrong variable name for printing the percent of Brian
   * Using “pBrian” instead of “pctBrian”
   * The error message picked up the exact mistake saying “'pBrian' was not declared in this scope; did you mean 'pctBrian'?”
   * Also gave me a warning saying the ‘pctBrian’ was an unused variable which is also correct
